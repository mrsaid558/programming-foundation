Making Decision In Code
    - there is defintion in python and other programming languages called boolean expression
        and boolean expression used in programming languages that produces a boolean value when
        evaluated

    - and boolean value is either true or false
    
    - for example
        * is 4 equal to 2 * 2 => true
        * is 4 greater than 5 => false
        * is my name "frank" => false
    
    - The first relational operator we'll look at is the equality operator. 
        It's represented by a double equal sign (==)
        * like => 4 == 2 * 2  #True

    - if we want to check if the two values is not equal we use (!=) and it's meen not equal

    - we can to check if the the 5 greater than 4 or the opposite
