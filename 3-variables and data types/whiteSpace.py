WhiteSpace

    - we add white space to make the code easier to read and understand

    -  we add white space. between the different elements of our statements
    
    - name = input("what's your name: ") => this is the right way
    
    - name=input("what's your name: ") => this is the wrong way
    
    -  mybe whitespaces is not very importnat for the different elements and don't cause in a problem
    
    - but it is very important between the keywords because it makes problems
